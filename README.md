# ArmySimApp
This is my first app so please judge me!

This Android application is being developed on request for a friend of mine and in order for me to practice Android app development.

Basically this app acts as an editor and simulation program where you can write up armies by defining values like attack, lives, etc. on a per row basis and run round based simulations with (theoretically) arbitrary amounts of armies.

The app is developed by me (@SebiderSushi) alone in english and german. This is supposed to be and stay a one man project but if you want to make the world a better place you can always help me sort out my worst coding errors.
